# Invistigate-A-Dataset-Udacity-Project

In this project, we are going to invistigate TMDB (The Movies Data Base), The reason I picked this data for is that I love cinema and I'm a big fan of alot of movies, actors and directors, I'm always fond of tracking all news about movies and actors, So, this data set would be great for feeding my interests, I want to know alot about this data set and I have alot of questions about it, which I will try to answer using by analysing thisdata set, and these questions are:

Q1: How is the growth of the revenue of movies over years?

Q2: Which movie genres are the most popular and has the most revenue overtime?

Q3: Who are the most popular directors from 2010 : 2015?

Q4: Does the popularity affect the number of votes or not ?

Q5: is the vote count increased over years or not ?

Q6: Who is the actor that acted in the highest number of movies in this data set?

Q7: What are the movie details that have tha highest and lowest vote average?
